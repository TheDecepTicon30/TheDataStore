There were about eight banks who were bankers to the government s schemes and 23 recipient banks who received payments on beneficiary accounts, said a senior official from  National  Payment  Corporation of  India, on condition of anonymity. NPCIhas set up the  Aadhar enabled payment systems for the transfer of cash subsidies. The government had earlier mandated  Aadhar cards for transfer of benefits, but on  Monday Finance Minister P  Chidambaramsaid that the cash would be transferred to the beneficiary accounts, even if they do not have Unique  Identity cards.  The total amount transferred to the account of beneficiaries without  Aadhar numbers could not be determined. The government on  Tuesday rolled out transfer of benefits for 10 schemes, including  Janani  Suraksha  Yojana, Mahatma  Gandhi National  Rural  Employment  Guarantee  Scheme,  District welfare schemes,  Rural  Development  Schemes and student scholarships and stipends.  Over the next few days or weeks, we will aim at 100 penetration of  Aadhaar beneficiaries...whether there is  Aadhaar card or not money will be credited, money will be withdrawn,  Finance ministersaid. The government had announced transfer of cash subsidies in 43 districts by  January 1.  But now it is being done in a phased manner starting with 20 districts in  Karnataka, Andhra  Pradesh,  Delhi,  Rajasthan, Madhya  Pradeshand  Punjab. All the 43 districts will be covered by  March 1.  So far about 20.4 crore people have enrolled for  Aadhar membership, data from UIDAIshows.  The government planned to transfer benefits to about 2 lakh beneficiaries of seven schemes in 20 districts on  Tuesday. Public sector bankshave been opening accounts in the 51 districts on a war footing, increasing the coverage through business correspondents. However, a major problem, bankers say, has been the lack of sufficient number of hand held devices for the banking correspondents that would be necessary in case of requirement of cash withdrawals by beneficiaries in far flung areas . \",\"Date\":\"2013-01-02 01:58:00\",\"Source\":\"econominc-times\",\"Subtitle\":null,\"Tags\":\" DBT, Direct cash transfer, P Chidambaram, Unique Identity Cards, Aadhar, finance, Finance minister \",\"Title\":\" Direct Cash Transfer: Govt transfers Rs 35.45 lakh on launch day \"},{\"Unnamed: 0\":1,\"Author\":\" BySatish John, ET Bureau \",\"Category\":\" Industry, Energy, Oil Gas \",\"Content\":\"  MUMBAI:  The  Ruia brothers and their bankers are trying to cobble together a complex deal, to be signed on the high seas, to bring down the borrowing requirement of  Essar  Energy s  Jamnagar refinery by 600 million.  If it fructifies, the transaction will be a first of its kind in  India. The  Indian firm has taken a leaf from its  UK based refinery subsidiary  Stanlow  Refinery whose crude inventory and finished products are managed by the  British bank  Barclays under a similar deal. Encouraged by the significant cost benefits,  Essar  Energy is now in active discussions with a team of  MNC banks that will own and manage its multi million barrel crude inventory.  If lawyers and bankers give the green signal, the deal will be cut on the high seas while the crude is being ferried from  Latin  American coast to  Gujarat. For  Essar  Energy, it takes almost 35 days for the crude it buys from  Latin  America to reach  Jamnagar.  The contours of the deal suggest that banks will hold the crude oil on their books and pass on the inventory to the refiner just before it is processed. The  Stanlow  Refinery, which  Essar acquired for 350 million, has saved 40 interest cost on working capital loans by letting banks own the crude and the refined products.  We are talking to a number of banks...mostly foreign banks,  Naresh  Nayyar,  CEO,  Essar  Energy told  ET.  I m not ready to give any timeline.  We are exploring it, and this is probably the first time any  Indian company is exploring this possibility, he said.  Essar s local refinery capacity is about 20 MMTPA and refining complexity has been raised to 6.1 11.8, allowing it to import crude cargoes from oil rich  Latin  American countries. The deal with  Barclays had helped in removing the working capital debt, substantially reduce the capital intensity of the  Stanlow  Refinery and improve returns, said  Andrew  Turpin, spokesperson for the  UK subsidiary,  Essar  Energy  Plc.  Post the deal with  Barclays, the refinery has lowered its working capital by 824 million.  It improves operating flexibility, particularly in high oil price environment and also allows  Essar  Oil  UK to substantially de risk itself from the impact of international oil price fluctuations on the inventories owned by the company previously crude was held for average 19 days on site, now it is delivered just in time by the bank and priced daily,  Andrew  Turpin, spokesperson for  Essar  Energy said. But in  India, oil refiners such as  Essar cannot straight away replicate the  Stanlow deal because of local tax laws.  Since there is tax implication every time a transaction is closed,  Essar is putting together a deal that involves sale and purchase with banks outside the  Indian territorial waters. While the pact with  Barclays covers crude as well as the final products, the deal being negotiated for the  Indian refinery will be restricted to the crude inventory. The compulsions behind such deals are high crude price, settling above 100 a barrel, and the huge expenses involved running a large refinery. \",\"Date\":\"2013-01-02 01:57:00\",\"Source\":\"econominc-times\",\"Subtitle\":\" The Ruia brothers and their bankers are trying to cobble together a complex deal, to be signed on the high seas, to bring down the borrowing requirement of Essar Energy s Jamnagar refinery by 600 million. \",\"Tags\":\" Essar Engery, Naresh Nayyar, Jamnagar refinery, Stanlow refinery, Ruia brothers, crude inventory management \",\"Title\":\" Essar Engery in talks with lenders for crude inventory management deal \"},{\"Unnamed: 0\":2,\"Author\":\" PTI \",\"Category\":\" News, Politics and Nation \",\"Content\":\"  SINGAPORE:  A 13 year old Indian studenthas been arrested here by Singaporepolice for posting a Facebookmessage in which he allegedly threatened to bomb a luxury casino resort in the city state.

Haryana s labour and employment minister Shiv  Charan  Sharmadrew the ire of  Opposition  BJP and women s organisations as he praised  Kanda and said the case he had been booked in was not such a big one.  This isn t such a big case.

It s just a bad time for my brother  Gopal  Kanda.  But very soon he will be proved innocent and these rumours will die on their own,  Sharma said.  The celebrations were also marked by a hawan and a health camp.  The minister had also said  Kanda is a brave and honest person who has been falsely implicated by those who are jealous of his phenomenal growth in life. Chief  Parliamentary  Secretary and  Fatehabad  MLA  Prahalad  Singh, who was also present at the event, said that he is sure that the rumours against  Kanda would soon die down.  His birthday is being celebrated in jail and in  Delhi also.  Gopal  Kanda is always among us.  He doesn t get afraid of anything.  He doesn t fear anyone,  Sharma said.  He later sought to downplay the controversy saying the case is in the court.  I respect the court and it will decide whether he is guilty or not.  If he has committed a crime, court will charge him otherwise he will be released.  CBI is investigating the case.  Within a few days we will get the result of the investigation, he added.

These include scholarships for  SC,  ST and  OBCs students, the  Indira  Gandhi  Matrutva  Sahayata  Yojana,  Dhanalakshmi scheme and a stipend scheme for  SC  ST job seekers.  The direct benefit transfer scheme will eventually include payouts from 26 schemes.  Starting next month, 11 more districts will be covered and another 12 districts will be covered from  March 1, taking the total to 43. \",\"Date\":\"2013-01-02 04:14:00\",\"Source\":\"econominc-times\",\"Subtitle\":\" Global electronic payments firm Visa International has offered the use of its nationwide network for the government s ambitious direct benefit transfer scheme \",\"Tags\":\" UIDAI, Visa International, Aadhar, cash subsidies, Banks, ATMs, ICICI bank \",\"Title\":\" Visa offers network for distributing cash subsidies to Aadhar cardholders \"},{\"Unnamed: 0\":9,\"Author\":\" ByVithal C Nadkarni, ET Bureau \",\"Category\":\" Opinion, Vedanta \",\"Content\":\"  The  Little  Rann of  Kutch is a desert with a difference.  The arid expanse is the last refuge of the  Khur, or the  Indian  Wild  Ass, which is a subspecies of the  Onager of  Biblical fame.  Your columnist made first contact with the lithe and limpid eyed animals recently in their sanctuary at  Dasada. Their carefree and noble demeanour at once reminded us of the equine avatar of  Vishnu called Hayagriva.  The  Biblical bard asks similarly,  Who has sent the wild onager free?  He s alluding to  God s touch as conveyed by the creature. Vindication of these divine links came from social networks,  God, in one of his unique forms, was the spontaneous comment of a friend to the picture of the animal gracefully caught in midstride  Close on its heels came another friend s comment that voted the picture, with no prompting, as the most beautiful donkey in the world .  The comment ended with a question asking whether the picture was of the most beautiful horse (or equine) that we saw on the entire network?  Vishnu s equine avatar makes similar, lofty associations in  Indic mythology.  Hayagriva is worshipped as the  God of  Knowledge and  Wisdom.  The human body with the horse s head, brilliantly white clad in white garments and seated upon a thousand rayed white lotus symbolising the  Brahman, is said to represent the triumph of pure knowledge. Guided by the hand of  God, it also stands for victory of ultimate goodness over basic animalistic passions.  Hayagriva is a pivotal deity in Vaishnavitetradition:  He blesses both sacred and secular studies. \",\"Date\":\"2013-01-02 05:18:00\",\"Source\":\"econominc-times\",\"Subtitle\":null,\"Tags\":\" Gold, Vaishnavite, Hayagriva, Horse sense \",\"Title\":\" Horse sense \"}]'"
